												<h2>Cryptocurrency Trading Tools</h2>
											</header>
										  <p>Using my passion for cryptocurrency and blockchain in general, I built an automated trading tool for the Binance exchange using Python and
												Binance's API in order to automate buys, sells, and stop losses. I then set up my own cloud server and whenever I need to trade, I can
												run the code specific to the relevant cryptocurrency being traded overnight without the need to constantly update orders and monitor the market.
												Additionally, I wrote an arbitrage script that abuses price discrepancies between the Binance Exchange and Kucoin Exchange for a multitude
												of cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, ICX, VET, NANO, etc.). Currently, I am developing a methodology and algorithm to completely automate the trading
												process reliably without the need for any human interaction.</p> <!--the source code can be found on my github page-->

													<h2>Canadian Spectrum Auction Trading Bot</h2>
												</header>
												<p>For our algorithmic game theory class, we were tasked to build an automated agent in Java to participate in the Canadian
													Spectrum Auction that would optimally bid and beat other students and the bots designed by the TA's. Our
													specific implementation of the trading agent didn't lose a single round to another student's bot or the TA's bot. The
													code can be found on my Github page.</p> <!--the source code can be found on my github page-->

														<h2>Prediction Market Bot</h2>
													</header>
													<p>Again in our algorithmic game theory class, we were tasked to design a trading agent in Java that would optimally perform
													in the specific prediction market that our professor created. This implementation was less complex than the Spectrum
												Auction bot, but performed just as well relatively in the competition phase. The code can be found on my Github as well.</p> <!--the source code can be found on my github page-->

										support code was given, and again Brown used the MOSS plagiarism detection in order to verify the integrity of students' work. The more
										complex projects can be found on my Github coded as B, C, and D in order to ensure that new students can't find the projects to copy.</p><!--the source code is on my github page-->
