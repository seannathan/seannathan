									<p>Due to starting out as a pre-med major, I have vast microbiology research experience as well as experience in emergency medicine. However, upon switching to computer science, I found that these two disciplines are intertwined in such a way that my experience in the life sciences could prove invaluable. Additionally I have also taken to economics, and the combination of these 3 disciplines has given me a broader perspective, especially pertaining to non-linear dynamic systems.</p>
									<p>As a computer science major, I am most interested in algorithms, cryptography and cybersecurity, and back-end development. So far, I have significant programming experience in Java and Python and am profecient with HTML/CSS/Javascript.

												<h2>Brown EMS: 2015-2017</h2>
											</header>
										  <p>From 2014-2016, I served as a licensed EMT for Brown Emergency Medical Services (EMS). I worked 12-hour night shifts twice a week, and encountered a range of scenarios ranging from anaphylactic shock, cardiac arrest, and the occasional overly drunk college student. These experiences helped me to learn to work efficiently in a fast-paced, stress induced environment because sometimes lives were on the line.</p>

									<h2>Brown University Microbiology: Summer 2015</h2>
								</header>
								<p>In the summer of 2015, I worked with <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/wfairbro" target ="_blank"> Dr. William Fairbrother </a> on research regarding the disruption of pre-mRNA splicing, a common mechanic for many disease mutations (>30% of all hereditary dieases mutations may be due to disruptions in RNA splicing).</p>
								<p>I used Real-Time PCR analysis and cell culturing methods to create these disruptions (single nucleotide polymorphs) and then analyze and catalog the specific splices in order to determine the effects on cultured cells.</p>

									<h2>LSU Microbiology Research: 2013-2015</h2>
								</header>
								<p> I worked with a team on the correlation between HPV/EBV infection and cancer in middle aged men. I ran solo proliferation and invasion assays on specific cell samples to corrobrate my findings. In addition, I performed Laser Capture Microdissection on tissue samples from middle aged male cancer patients. </p>
								<p> I ended up writing a research paper regarding my findings on how the biomarkers CD21 and CK19 could be used to detect the presence of this specific variation of canceer in its early stages and ended up placing 3rd  at the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF).</p>
