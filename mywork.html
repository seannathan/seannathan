									<p>Due to starting out as a pre-med major, I have vast microbiology research experience as well as experience in emergency medicine. However, upon switching to computer science, I found that these two disciplines are intertwined in such a way that my experience in the life sciences could prove invaluable. Additionally I have also taken to economics, and the combination of these 3 disciplines has given me a broader perspective on life.</p>
									<p>As a computer science major, I am most interested in machine learning, database management, cybersecurity, and AI. So far, I have significant programming experience in Java and Python and am profecient with HTML/CSS/Javascript. I have worked loosely with Angular2 and mySQL.

										  <p>As a teaching assistant, I have multiple responsibilities ranging from holding a two hour session once a week to help students
										  debug and fix code relating to projects, holding section once a week in order to better students' understanding of programming in
									   	Java, and designing and grading large scale projects for the class. The professor of the class is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andries_van_Dam" target = "_blank"> Andy Van Dam </a>.</p>

								<p>This year, I worked with a team of students to help revamp and manage the Brown Spring Weekend ticketing app and database. I mainly

									<h2>Server at Chili's Bar and Grill: 2016-2017</h2>

								<p> I worked as a server over the summer and was surprised by how much I learned regarding interpersonal communication
								during my time at the restaurant. This job was very demanding, requiring me to serve at peak hours 7 to 8 tables at a time while
							ensuring that every customer I was taking care of was satisfied. Chili's has a server rating system that each customer fills out after their
						meal, and I am most proud of the fact that I held the highest server rating in the restaurant for a 6 month period.</p>

									<h2>Brown EMS: 2015-2017</h2>
								</header>
								<p> Due to starting out as a premed major, I served as a licensed EMT for Brown Emergency Medical Services (EMS). I worked 12-hour night shifts twice a week, and encountered a range of scenarios ranging from anaphylactic shock, cardiac arrest, and the occasional overly drunk college student. These experiences helped me to learn to work efficiently in a fast-paced, stress induced environment because sometimes lives were on the line.</p>

									<h2>Brown University Microbiology: Summer 2015</h2>

								<p>In the summer of 2015, I worked with <a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/wfairbro" target ="_blank"> Dr. William Fairbrother </a> on research regarding the disruption of pre-mRNA splicing, a common mechanic for many disease mutations (>30% of all hereditary dieases mutations may be due to disruptions in RNA splicing).
								I used Real-Time PCR analysis and cell culturing methods to create these disruptions (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and then analyze and catalog the specific splices in order to determine the effects on cultured cells.</p>
